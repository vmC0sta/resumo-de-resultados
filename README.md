## Overview

## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS
- Javascript 

### What I learned

I learned how to consume JSON files (believe me, this was the worst part) and how to communicate better with CSS and @media queries

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```js
fetch('data.json')
    .then((response)=>{
        return response.json()
    })
    .then((data)=>{
        data = JSON.stringify(data)
        data = JSON.parse(data)
}
```
